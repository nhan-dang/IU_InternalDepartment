The wordpress project is like using the tools to create a website
Every new themes, new pages, ... will be directly updated in the wordpress folder
Thus this git here will just contain all the files, folders that have been automatically created by wordpress cms and logic, backend
Team members will copy the files, folders to their wordpress folder after revising the works of others
The only folder in wordpress after downloaded, installed will be modified throughout working is wp-content. The wp-includes folder will changed when installed more plugin and so on, however currently right now there is no need for new plugin.
To connect wordpress to mysql, first add "global wpdb;" to use the predefined variable of connection of wordpress during installation. Using function "get_result" instead of "query" to return the result of the mysql commands.
